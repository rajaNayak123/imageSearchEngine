# Image Search Engine

  - This code appears to be for a simple web-based image search engine. It consists of three main parts:
an HTML file for the structure of the webpage, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file for
handling user interactions and making API requests.

- It uses the Unsplash API to fetch and display images based on user queries.

  ## How its work
  Image Search Application contains an input field, which takes the choice or type of the image for which the user is searching. When the user enters the search string and clicks on the button, the top 10 images are shown to the user. If the user wants more images, then there is a Generate More button through which more images can be generated.
